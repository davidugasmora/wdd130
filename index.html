            <p>Hello everyone! I am from Costa Rica, but right now I am living in San Antonio, Texas. I am a Software Developer Mayor, I just began but I am excited to continue learning more about Web development with all of you. I come from a big and diverse Family where my father is from Peru and my mother is from Costa Rica, and we are five siblings in total. The things that I normally like to do when I have free time are reading, playing video games, doing exercise and passing time with my family.</p>
